# Volatility Analysis Using GARCH(2,1) Model on Tech Stocks

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing volatility in the tech stock sector using the GARCH(2,1) model, a commonly used model in financial econometrics for volatility clustering. The analysis reveals patterns of volatility persistence and the impact of market shocks on tech stocks. By modeling volatility dynamics, the project identifies time-dependent risk factors, providing valuable insights for risk management and trading strategies.

## Key Objectives

- **Volatility Modeling**: Use the GARCH(2,1) model to capture volatility patterns in major tech stocks.
- **Shock Impact Analysis**: Quantify the impact of market shocks on stock volatility.
- **Risk Identification**: Identify volatility clustering and time-dependent risk factors to aid in risk management.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Collected historical stock price data for a selection of major tech stocks (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, NVDA) from financial databases.
   
2. **GARCH Model Implementation**:
   - Applied the GARCH(2,1) model to model volatility persistence.
   - Estimated the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to assess shock impact and volatility persistence.
   
3. **Volatility Persistence Analysis**:
   - Analyzed the $\beta$ coefficient to determine the extent of volatility clustering, with $\beta > 0.70$ indicating strong persistence.
   - Examined $\alpha$ values to understand the sensitivity of each stock to market shocks.
   
4. **Time-Dependent Risk Factors**:
   - Investigated how volatility changes over time in response to external events.
   - Identified significant clustering that reflects the time-dependent nature of risk in the tech sector.

## Results

- **Volatility Persistence**: The analysis showed strong volatility persistence for tech stocks, with $\beta$ values consistently greater than 0.70, indicating that past volatility influences future volatility.
- **Shock Impact**: The $\alpha$ values showed a significant impact from market shocks, affecting all stocks analyzed and revealing their sensitivity to sudden market movements.
- **Volatility Clustering**: Observed substantial volatility clustering in tech stocks, demonstrating that high-volatility periods tend to be followed by similar periods, increasing short-term risk in the sector.

## Skills and Tools Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Statsmodels, Matplotlib
- **Modeling Techniques**: GARCH(2,1) Model
- **Data Sources**: Financial databases for historical price data (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpaca API)

## Conclusion

This volatility analysis using the GARCH(2,1) model demonstrates the high persistence of volatility in tech stocks and their sensitivity to market shocks. The findings provide a foundation for understanding the time-dependent nature of risk in the tech sector and highlight the importance of managing volatility for risk-averse investors.

## Future Work

- **Higher-Order GARCH Models**: Experiment with GARCH models of higher order (e.g., GARCH(3,1)) to capture more complex volatility patterns.
- **Sector Comparison**: Compare volatility persistence in tech stocks to other sectors to identify industry-specific risk factors.
- **Machine Learning Approaches**: Integrate machine learning techniques for dynamic volatility forecasting and improved risk management.
